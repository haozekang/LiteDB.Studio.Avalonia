# LiteDB.Studio.Avalonia
This is the Avalonia version of LiteDB.Studio. Originally, LiteDB is an embedded file database for cross-platform use, but it only provides a management tool for Windows. Based on the original LiteDB.Studio and Avalonia technology, we have refactored the code to develop a cross-platform version, so now you can read LiteDB databases across platforms!
