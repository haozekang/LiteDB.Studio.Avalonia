# LiteDB.Studio.Avalonia
Originally, LiteDB was a cross-platform embedded file database, but its management tools were only available for Windows. Based on the original LiteDB.Studio and Avalonia technology, we have refactored the code to develop a cross-platform version. Now you can read LiteDB databases across platforms!
